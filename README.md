## Abstract
The problem of features ranking arises in many practical fields. In this paper, we work with medical data to rank the potential predictors of medical issue called «fibrillation». To do it, we use an Eigenvector Centrality (EC) method, proposed by the work Ranking to Learn:
Feature Ranking and Selection via Eigenvector Centrality (2017). The result of this will be delivered to the National Cardiology Center in Moscow and could be reasonable for the future real practice.
